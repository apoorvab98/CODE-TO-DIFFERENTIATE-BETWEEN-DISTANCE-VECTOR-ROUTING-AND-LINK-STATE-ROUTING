# CODE-TO-DIFFERENTIATE-BETWEEN-DISTANCE-VECTOR-ROUTING-AND-LINK-STATE-ROUTING

A JAVA program which will differentiate between distance vector routing (DVR) and link state routing (LSR).
Consider ‘n’ number of nodes/routers in a network.
Make sure that number of links are greater than n.
Randomly initialize weights for each link.
For any source and destination find the shortest path chosen by DVR and LSR.

Link State Routing uses Djkstra algorithm and Distance Vector Routing uses BellMan-Ford Algorithm.

The code is implemented using Java.
